  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <h2>Who are we</h2>
  <p>Hedmenn Strauss (Pty) Ltd was established in
2006, with a vision to be a financial services
provider for sustainable energy solutions.
We develop projects that fulfill a specific client
need, through collaborative efforts with them
using mature software technonologies from leading
industry providers as well as technical expertise
from Original Equipment Manufacturers; Engineering
Service Providers and Financial Institutions.

A problem solving approach that works,
for a sustainable energy future.
<h2>What is Project Development</h2>
  </p> The effort to establish energy needs; and
create an enabling environment often
involves hidden costs ; misaligned technical
outcomes and a lot of regulation.
Our project development process spans
over 12 years of experience, with established
expertise in putting a project together.
Hedmenn’s specific area of expertise is
Photovoltaic as well as Biomass Technology.
The industry is rapidly changing, with Hydrogen
and Battery Energy Storage now becoming a
key development area, while incorporating the
former Technologies in their development. <p>
  <h2>How integral is Financial Services
to Project Development</h2>
  <p>Maturity of the sustainable energy industry has
led to much easier determinations of a project’s
viability, which brings to fore the next hurdke
of capital investment, in both the development
process as well as the construction process. Our experience in the former as a licensed Venture
Capital Company, and the latter as authorised
intermediary of Project and Commercial Insurance
products, allowing us to offer bancassurance services.</p>
<H2>Where does Credit Provision
feature in Project Development</H2>
<p> When Project Developers requires only
working capital to service markets such as
Commercial and Industrial clients.
A combination of products such as financial
guarantees and credit guarantees can sometimes
be the difference between a planned project and
an executed project, as it can facilitate short-term
credit facilities through financial institutions.
Hedmenns is an intermediary for a panel of
underwriters offering such products, as well
as those during the execution phase.</p>
